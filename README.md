## The Interactive Project

Interactivity is commonly recognized as an important feature of contemporary games and media, but its roles in older modes of communication and its potential as an exploratory tool are not widely understood. Under the direction of Chris Reyns-Chikuma (MLCS), Astrid Ensslin (MLCS-HC) and Walter Davis (EASIA), sponsored by SSHRC and KIAS, and in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Education, and several Departments, the Interactive Project (TIP) proposes that interactivity should be both a subject of investigation and a means of generating new understanding. During a 5-week (Sept.27 -Oct.29, 2021) cross-disciplinary event, the project will bring scholars, creators, students, and the general public together to explore the complex ways in which interactivity has articulated human experience throughout our history and continues to do so today. 

## Gaming 

Interactivity is one of the main constituents defining the reality of video games; and sight, sound, and touch are the most prevalent senses triggered by a game console. 
TIP â€“ The Interactive Game has also introduced us to various other means of interaction through portals, mirrors, puzzles, Marios (avatars), Instagram (social media), and selfies.
